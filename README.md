# C++ CRUD Application with SQLite

This project demonstrates a complete implementation of a **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using **C++** and **SQLite**. It serves as a practical example of database interaction, robust error handling, and effective input validation in a C++ environment.

## Features

* **Create:** Add new records to the database through the console interface.
* **Read:** Retrieve and display existing data from the database.
* **Update:** Modify existing records in the database, with **ID validation** for secure updates.
* **Delete:** Remove records from the database, also with **ID validation** to prevent accidental deletions.
* **Easy-to-Use Console Interface:** Provides a streamlined and intuitive command-line experience for data management.
* **Enhanced Console Styling:** Improves readability and user experience through basic console formatting.
* **Dynamic SQL Query Building:** Constructs SQL queries programmatically, offering flexibility and reducing code duplication.
* **Automated Table Creation:** Ensures database integrity by automatically creating the necessary table if it doesn't exist.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Implements comprehensive error checking for database operations and user input.
* **Input Validation:** Validates user input to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.

## Technologies Used

* **C++:** The primary programming language for the application logic.
* **SQLite:** A lightweight, file-based relational database management system.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* **Database Interaction:** Demonstrates how to connect to and interact with an SQLite database using C++ libraries (e.g., `sqlite3`).
* **CRUD Operations:** Provides a clear implementation of the fundamental Create, Read, Update, and Delete database operations.
* **Error Handling:** Showcases best practices for handling potential errors during database interactions and user input.
* **Input Validation:** Illustrates techniques for validating user-provided data to maintain data integrity.
* **Dynamic SQL:** Explores how to build SQL queries programmatically based on user input or application logic.
* **ID Validation:** Emphasizes the importance of validating record IDs before performing update or delete operations for data security.
* **Console Interface Design:** Presents a basic yet effective approach to building interactive console applications.
* **Software Development Best Practices:** Reflects an understanding of writing robust, efficient, and maintainable code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
* The SQLite development library (usually available through your system's package manager, e.g., `libsqlite3-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `sqlite-devel` on Fedora/CentOS).

### Compilation

1.  Save the C++ source code files (e.g., `main.cpp`, `database.cpp`, `database.h`).
2.  Compile the project using your C++ compiler. For example, using g++:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp database.cpp -o crud -lsqlite3
    ```
    (Replace `main.cpp` and `database.cpp` with your actual file names).

### Running the Application

1.  Execute the compiled binary:
    ```bash
    ./crud
    ```
2.  Follow the prompts in the console interface to interact with the application and manage data.

## Project Structure

The project likely includes the following files:

* `main.cpp`: Contains the main program logic and user interface.
* `database.h`: Header file defining the database interaction class or functions.
* `database.cpp`: Source file implementing the database interaction logic (connecting, querying, etc.).
* Potentially other files for specific functionalities or data structures.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement more sophisticated console styling and user interface elements.
* Add more comprehensive data validation rules.
* Introduce data searching and filtering capabilities.
* Explore using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for more abstract database interaction.
* Consider a graphical user interface (GUI) using a framework like Qt or wxWidgets.
